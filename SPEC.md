# üß© LocalSQL Explorer

*A local desktop application for exploring and querying CSV, XLSX, and Parquet files using SQL.*

---

## 1. Overview

**LocalSQL Explorer** is a Python desktop app that allows users to:

* Import datasets from CSV, Excel (XLSX), or Parquet files.
* Treat each file as a table within an embedded DuckDB database.
* Run SQL queries (including joins across multiple tables).
* View results in an interactive table view.
* Export query results to various formats.
* Save or load a persistent DuckDB database for future use.

This project emphasizes **spec-driven development**, ensuring all features are clearly defined before implementation.

## 10. Testing & Validation

All functional components must be covered by automated tests where practical.
Tests verify correctness, stability, and data integrity for all core workflows.

### 10.1 Unit Tests

| Module                 | Tests                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Importer**           | - Imports CSV, XLSX, and Parquet correctly.<br> - Handles invalid files gracefully (raises readable errors).                               |
| **DuckDB Integration** | - Tables are registered correctly.<br> - Query execution returns expected row/column counts.<br> - Invalid SQL raises a handled exception. |
| **Exporter**           | - Exports query results to CSV/XLSX/Parquet.<br> - Output schema matches query schema.                                                     |
| **Persistence**        | - Saving and reloading `.duckdb` retains tables and data.<br> - Round-trip validation (data in == data out).                               |

### 10.2 Integration Tests

| Workflow                                   | Expected Result                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Import multiple files and run a join query | Query executes and result matches expected output. |
| Export after query                         | Exported file contains correct data and headers.   |
| Save and reload session                    | UI reloads with all tables and schema intact.      |
| Drop/Rename table                          | Table list and database schema update accordingly. |

### 10.3 UI Tests (optional)

If using PyQt6:

* Use `pytest-qt` to simulate user interactions:

  * File import dialog opens correctly.
  * Running a query updates the result table.
  * Error messages display in the status bar.

### 10.4 Performance Checks

* Import 1M-row CSV within <10 seconds on standard laptop hardware.
* Query execution under 3 seconds for simple filters or joins on moderate datasets.
