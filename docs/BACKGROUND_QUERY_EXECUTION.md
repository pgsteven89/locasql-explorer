# Background Query Execution Implementation

## Overview
Implemented non-blocking background query execution using Qt's QThread to prevent UI freezing during long-running SQL queries.

## Changes Made

### 1. New File: `src/localsql_explorer/ui/query_worker.py`
Created three worker classes for background execution:

- **QueryWorker**: Executes single SQL queries in background
  - Signals: `progress_update`, `query_finished`, `query_error`
  - Supports cancellation via `cancel()` method
  
- **PaginatedQueryWorker**: Sets up paginated query execution in background
  - Signals: `progress_update`, `paginator_ready`, `query_error`
  - Handles large result sets efficiently
  
- **MultiQueryWorker**: Executes multiple queries sequentially in background
  - Signals: `progress_update`, `query_completed`, `all_queries_finished`, `query_error`
  - Provides progress updates for each query
  - Supports cancellation mid-execution

### 2. Modified: `src/localsql_explorer/ui/main_window.py`

#### Added Imports
```python
from .query_worker import QueryWorker, PaginatedQueryWorker, MultiQueryWorker
```

#### Added Instance Variables
```python
self.query_worker: Optional[QueryWorker] = None
self.paginated_worker: Optional[PaginatedQueryWorker] = None
self.multi_query_worker: Optional[MultiQueryWorker] = None
self.multi_query_progress: Optional[QProgressDialog] = None
```

#### Updated Methods

**`run_query()`**
- Now checks if a query is already running
- Offers to cancel existing query before running new one
- Delegates to background execution methods

**New: `_execute_query_standard_bg()`**
- Replaces blocking `_execute_query_standard()`
- Creates QueryWorker and connects signals
- Updates UI when query completes

**New: `_execute_query_with_pagination_bg()`**
- Replaces blocking `_execute_query_with_pagination()`
- Creates PaginatedQueryWorker and connects signals
- Sets up paginated view when ready

**`run_all_queries()`**
- Completely rewritten for background execution
- Uses MultiQueryWorker for non-blocking execution
- Shows progress dialog with cancel button
- Updates query history in background

**New Signal Handlers:**
- `_on_query_progress()`: Updates progress bar
- `_on_query_finished()`: Handles successful query completion
- `_on_query_error()`: Handles query errors
- `_on_paginator_ready()`: Sets up paginated results
- `_on_multi_query_progress()`: Updates multi-query progress
- `_on_single_query_completed()`: Handles individual query in batch
- `_on_single_query_error()`: Handles individual query error
- `_on_all_queries_finished()`: Finalizes batch execution
- `_cancel_multi_query()`: Cancels multi-query execution

**New: `_show_all_queries_summary_bg()`**
- Shows summary dialog for background multi-query execution

## Benefits

### UI Responsiveness
- ✅ UI remains fully responsive during query execution
- ✅ Users can interact with other parts of the application
- ✅ Counter/clock continues updating (proves non-blocking)

### Better User Experience
- ✅ Progress updates show current operation
- ✅ Queries can be cancelled mid-execution
- ✅ No "Not Responding" windows during long queries

### Robustness
- ✅ Error handling in worker threads
- ✅ Proper cleanup of worker objects
- ✅ Multiple queries don't block each other

## Testing

### Test Script: `test_background_queries.py`
Created comprehensive test to verify:
1. Database setup with 10,000 rows
2. Single slow query execution in background
3. Multiple queries execution in background
4. UI counter continues updating (proves non-blocking)

### How to Test
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe test_background_queries.py
```

### Test Procedure
1. Click "1. Setup Test Database" - creates 10,000 row table
2. Click "2. Run Slow Query (Background)" - runs complex query
3. **Watch the blue counter** - it should keep updating rapidly
4. Click "3. Run Multiple Queries (Background)" - runs 5 queries
5. **Watch the blue counter** - it should still keep updating

If the counter continues updating during query execution, the UI is NOT frozen! ✅

## Technical Details

### Threading Architecture
```
MainWindow (UI Thread)
    └─> Creates Worker (Background Thread)
        └─> Executes Query in DatabaseManager
        └─> Emits signals back to UI Thread
    └─> Receives signals and updates UI
```

### Signal/Slot Pattern
- Workers run in separate QThread
- Communication via Qt signals (thread-safe)
- UI updates only from main thread
- Workers cleaned up after completion

### Progress Tracking
- Standard queries: 10% → 30% → 70% → 80% → 100%
- Paginated queries: 10% → 30% → 70% → 85% → 100%
- Multi-queries: Progress per query (0 to N)

## Backward Compatibility

### Deprecated Methods (kept for compatibility)
- `_execute_query_standard()` - redirects to background version
- `_execute_query_with_pagination()` - redirects to background version

Both methods are marked as deprecated in docstrings.

## Known Limitations

### Query Cancellation
- Cancellation is cooperative (checks `_is_cancelled` flag)
- DuckDB queries cannot be interrupted mid-execution
- Worker waits for current query to complete before cancelling

### Thread Safety
- DatabaseManager must be thread-safe (DuckDB connections are)
- Only one worker per type should run at a time (enforced)

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. Add query queue for multiple simultaneous queries
2. Implement true query interruption (if DuckDB supports it)
3. Add estimated time remaining based on historical data
4. Show live row count updates during long queries
