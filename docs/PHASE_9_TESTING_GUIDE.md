# Phase 9 Implementation Testing Guide

## Overview
This document provides testing instructions for Phase 9 features: Multi-Tab SQL Editor & Query Execution Enhancements.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Tabbed SQL Editor Interface ✅

**Description**: Support multiple SQL editor tabs for working with different queries simultaneously.

**How to Test**:
1. Launch LocalSQL Explorer
2. You should see tabs at the top of the SQL editor area (starts with "Query 1")
3. Click the "+" button or press `Ctrl+T` to create a new tab
4. Write different SQL in each tab
5. Click tabs to switch between them
6. Press `Ctrl+Tab` to cycle to the next tab
7. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` to cycle to the previous tab
8. Double-click a tab title to rename it
9. Right-click a tab for context menu options:
   - Rename
   - Close
   - Close Others
   - Close Tabs to the Right
10. Click the "X" on a tab or press `Ctrl+W` to close it (minimum 1 tab always open)
11. Close and reopen the app - tabs should be restored with their content

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Multiple tabs can be created and managed
- ✅ Each tab maintains independent SQL content
- ✅ Tab state persists across app restarts
- ✅ Modified tabs show "*" indicator
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts work as expected

### 2. Multi-Query Support in Single Editor ✅

**Description**: Execute specific queries from editor containing multiple SQL statements.

**How to Test**:
1. In any editor tab, write multiple queries separated by semicolons:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active';
   
   SELECT id, name, email 
   FROM customers 
   WHERE created_at > '2024-01-01';
   
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;
   ```

2. The "Queries: N" label should show the number of detected queries
3. Place your cursor in the first query
4. Click "▶ Run Current Query" or press `Ctrl+Enter`
5. Only the first query should execute
6. Place cursor in the second query
7. Press `Ctrl+Enter` again
8. Only the second query should execute
9. Try placing cursor in the third query and execute

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Parser correctly identifies individual queries
- ✅ Only the query at cursor position executes
- ✅ Semicolons in strings don't break parsing: `'test;value'`
- ✅ Semicolons in comments are ignored: `-- comment; more`
- ✅ Query count label updates as you type

### 3. Run All Queries Functionality ✅

**Description**: Execute all queries in the current editor sequentially.

**How to Test**:
1. With multiple queries in the editor (from test above)
2. Click "▶▶ Run All Queries" button or press `Ctrl+Shift+Enter`
3. A progress dialog should appear showing "Executing query X of Y"
4. Each query executes in sequence
5. A summary dialog shows at the end with:
   - Total queries executed
   - Number successful/failed
   - Total rows returned
   - Total execution time
   - Details for each query
6. If a query fails, you're asked whether to continue
7. Click "Cancel" in the progress dialog to stop execution

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ All queries execute in order
- ✅ Progress is shown for each query
- ✅ Summary dialog displays correctly
- ✅ Failed queries are handled gracefully
- ✅ User can cancel execution mid-way
- ✅ Each query is added to query history
- ✅ Last query's result is displayed in results view

### 4. Keyboard Shortcut Enhancements ✅

**Description**: Add productivity shortcuts for query execution.

**Shortcuts to Test**:
- `Ctrl+Enter`: Run current query (at cursor position)
- `Ctrl+Shift+Enter`: Run all queries in current tab
- `Ctrl+T`: Create new tab
- `Ctrl+W`: Close current tab
- `Ctrl+Tab`: Switch to next tab
- `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`: Switch to previous tab
- `F5`: Legacy shortcut still works (runs current query)

**How to Test**:
1. Try each keyboard shortcut listed above
2. Hover over buttons to see tooltip with shortcut hint
3. Press `Ctrl+/` for keyboard shortcuts help (if implemented)

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ All shortcuts work as documented
- ✅ Tooltips show correct shortcuts
- ✅ `Ctrl+Enter` feels natural for query execution (like VS Code)
- ✅ Tab navigation shortcuts work smoothly

### 5. Query Parser Edge Cases ✅

**Description**: Handle complex SQL scenarios correctly.

**Test Cases**:

**A. Semicolons in Strings**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test;user@example.com';
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE notes = 'Status: pending; review needed';
```
Expected: 2 queries detected (not 4)

**B. Semicolons in Comments**
```sql
-- This comment has a semicolon; but it's ignored
SELECT * FROM users;
/* This block comment also has a semicolon; ignored */
SELECT * FROM orders;
```
Expected: 2 queries detected

**C. Nested Queries and CTEs**
```sql
WITH active_users AS (
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active'
)
SELECT * FROM active_users WHERE age > 25;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;
```
Expected: 2 queries detected

**D. Empty Queries and Whitespace**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
   
   
SELECT * FROM orders;
```
Expected: 2 queries detected (empty space ignored)

**E. Mixed Line Endings**
Test with queries containing different line endings (Windows/Unix)
Expected: All queries parsed correctly

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ All edge cases handled correctly
- ✅ No false positives or negatives
- ✅ Query boundaries detected accurately

## Integration Testing

### Complete Workflow Test

1. **Import Data**:
   - Import sample CSV files (employees.csv, company_data.csv)
   - Verify tables appear in table list

2. **Multi-Tab Workflow**:
   - Create 3 tabs: "Users", "Analytics", "Test Queries"
   - In "Users" tab: Write query to select from employees
   - In "Analytics" tab: Write multiple aggregate queries
   - In "Test Queries" tab: Write experimental queries
   - Switch between tabs with `Ctrl+Tab`

3. **Multi-Query Execution**:
   - In "Analytics" tab, write:
     ```sql
     SELECT COUNT(*) as total_employees FROM employees;
     SELECT AVG(salary) as avg_salary FROM employees;
     SELECT department, COUNT(*) as dept_count FROM employees GROUP BY department;
     ```
   - Run each query individually with `Ctrl+Enter`
   - Then run all with `Ctrl+Shift+Enter`
   - Verify summary shows all 3 queries succeeded

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Write a query with intentional error:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM nonexistent_table;
     SELECT * FROM employees;
     ```
   - Run all queries
   - Verify error dialog appears for first query
   - Choose "Yes" to continue
   - Second query should execute successfully

5. **Persistence**:
   - Close the application
   - Reopen it
   - Verify all 3 tabs are restored with their content
   - Verify active tab is the same as when closed

6. **Export Results**:
   - Run a multi-query set
   - Export the results
   - Verify export includes data from last executed query

## Performance Testing

### Large Query Sets

1. Create a tab with 50 simple SELECT queries
2. Click "Run All Queries"
3. Verify:
   - Progress updates smoothly
   - No UI freezing
   - All queries complete successfully
   - Summary is readable

### Large Result Sets

1. Create multi-query set returning large results:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM large_table LIMIT 10000;
   SELECT * FROM large_table LIMIT 20000;
   SELECT * FROM large_table LIMIT 30000;
   ```
2. Run all queries
3. Verify:
   - Pagination kicks in for large results
   - Memory usage stays reasonable
   - UI remains responsive

## Regression Testing

Verify existing features still work:

1. **Single Query Execution**: F5 still works for single queries
2. **Query History**: All queries (single and multi) appear in history
3. **Table List**: Still functional and responsive
4. **Export**: Can export query results
5. **Theme Toggle**: Dark/light theme works with new tabs
6. **CTE Support**: CTEs work in multi-query editor
7. **Auto-completion**: Still works in tabbed editor
8. **Syntax Highlighting**: Works correctly in all tabs

## Known Limitations

1. Results view shows only the last executed query's results when running multiple queries
2. Tab drag-and-drop might not persist order on restart (uses Qt's default tab reordering)
3. Very long tab names might be truncated in UI
