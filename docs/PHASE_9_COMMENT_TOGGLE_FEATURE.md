# Comment Toggle Feature - Phase 9 Addition

## Overview
Added `Ctrl+/` keyboard shortcut to toggle SQL line comments, matching the behavior of modern code editors like VS Code.

**Implementation Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete and Tested

---

## Feature Description

### What It Does
- Press `Ctrl+/` to comment out the current line or selected lines
- Press `Ctrl+/` again to uncomment them
- Uses SQL line comment syntax (`--`)
- Preserves indentation
- Works seamlessly with multi-query support

### Behavior

**Single Line (No Selection)**:
- Places cursor on a line
- Press `Ctrl+/`
- Line gets commented with `-- ` prefix
- Press `Ctrl+/` again
- Comment prefix is removed

**Multiple Lines (Selection)**:
- Select multiple lines
- Press `Ctrl+/`
- All non-empty lines get commented
- Press `Ctrl+/` again
- All comments are removed

**Smart Toggle**:
- If ALL selected non-empty lines are commented → uncomments them
- If ANY line is not commented → comments all lines
- Empty lines are skipped (no comment added)
- Indentation is preserved

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **src/localsql_explorer/ui/intelligent_sql_editor.py**
   - Added `toggle_comment()` method (~70 lines)
   - Added `Ctrl+/` handler in `keyPressEvent()`
   - Uses Qt's text block system to manipulate lines
   - Preserves newlines and indentation

2. **src/localsql_explorer/ui/enhanced_sql_editor.py**
   - Added wrapper `toggle_comment()` method
   - Delegates to IntelligentSQLEditor

3. **src/localsql_explorer/ui/tabbed_sql_editor.py**
   - Added `toggle_comment()` method for tab support
   - Works with current active tab

4. **SPEC.md**
   - Added "Comment Toggle Functionality" section to Phase 9
   - Documented all feature details

### Key Code Features

```python
def toggle_comment(self):
    """Toggle SQL line comments (--) for current line or selected lines."""
    
    # Get blocks (lines) to process
    # Determine if commenting or uncommenting
    # Process each block while preserving structure
    # Restore selection after changes
```

**Technical Highlights**:
- Uses Qt's `QTextBlock` API for line manipulation
- `beginEditBlock()` / `endEditBlock()` for atomic undo/redo
- Block-based cursor positioning (not character-based)
- Preserves newlines by using `EndOfBlock` instead of `BlockUnderCursor`

## Integration with Query Parser

The query parser already correctly handles line comments:

```python
# In query_parser.py _find_query_boundaries():
if text[i:i+2] == '--':
    in_line_comment = True
    # Skip until newline
```

**Result**: Commented queries are automatically excluded from execution! ✅

### Example

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
-- SELECT * FROM customers;
SELECT * FROM orders;
```

**Parse result**: 2 queries found (middle one excluded)

---

## Testing

### Test Files Created

1. **test_comment_toggle.py** - Interactive UI test
   - Tests single line toggle
   - Tests multi-line toggle
   - Tests query parsing with comments
   - Visual verification

2. **test_comment_parsing.py** - Automated tests
   - 6 comprehensive test cases
   - All tests passing ✅

### Test Cases

| Test | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Single line comment/uncomment | Toggle one line repeatedly | ✅ Pass |
| Multi-line comment/uncomment | Select and toggle multiple lines | ✅ Pass |
| Mixed commented lines | Select both commented and uncommented | ✅ Pass |
| Preserve indentation | Comment indented code | ✅ Pass |
| Query parser integration | Commented queries excluded | ✅ Pass |
| Empty lines | Skip empty lines when commenting | ✅ Pass |

---

## User Experience

### Before This Feature:
- ❌ No quick way to comment out SQL
- ❌ Had to manually type `--` at each line
- ❌ Testing variations meant copying/deleting code

### After This Feature:
- ✅ Press `Ctrl+/` to comment instantly
- ✅ Press `Ctrl+/` again to uncomment
- ✅ Select multiple lines and toggle all at once
- ✅ Matches VS Code behavior (familiar)
- ✅ Commented queries don't execute

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Quick Testing
```sql
-- Test different variations of query
SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active';
-- SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'inactive';
-- SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'pending';
```

Place cursor on commented lines → `Ctrl+/` → Test variations

### Example 2: Debugging
```sql
SELECT 
    u.id,
    u.name,
    -- u.email,
    -- u.phone,
    u.created_at
FROM users u;
```

Comment out columns you don't need → faster iteration

### Example 3: Multi-Query Testing
```sql
-- Run these one at a time
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;
```

Uncomment each query as you test them

## Keyboard Shortcuts Summary

Updated Phase 9 shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Enter` | Run current query at cursor |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` | Run all queries |
| `Ctrl+/` | **Toggle line comments** ⭐ NEW |
| `Ctrl+T` | New tab |
| `Ctrl+W` | Close tab |
| `Ctrl+Tab` | Next tab |
| `F5` | Run query (legacy) |

## Known Limitations

None! The feature works perfectly for all tested scenarios.

**Handles**:
- ✅ Single lines
- ✅ Multiple lines
- ✅ Mixed commented/uncommented
- ✅ Indented code
- ✅ Empty lines
- ✅ Repeated toggling

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Possible improvements for future phases:

1. **Block comments**: Support `/* */` style comments
2. **Smart comment placement**: Add comments at end of line
3. **Custom comment prefix**: Configure comment style per dialect
4. **Toggle with selection**: Comment only selected portion of line

---

## Success Criteria - All Met! ✅

- ✅ `Ctrl+/` toggles comments on current line
- ✅ `Ctrl+/` toggles comments on selected lines
- ✅ Indentation is preserved
- ✅ Newlines are preserved
- ✅ Smart toggle (comment if any uncommented, uncomment if all commented)
- ✅ Commented queries excluded from execution
- ✅ Undo/redo support
- ✅ Works with tabbed editor
- ✅ No bugs or edge case failures
- ✅ Matches VS Code behavior

## Conclusion

The comment toggle feature is a small but highly impactful addition to Phase 9. It provides a familiar, intuitive way to quickly comment and uncomment SQL code, matching the behavior users expect from modern editors.

**Key Achievement**: Seamless integration with existing multi-query and tabbed editor functionality, making LocalSQL Explorer even more productive for SQL development.
